# Gunicorn 25

## What it is

Gunicorn ("Green Unicorn") is a **WSGI HTTP server** for Python. A web framework such as Flask knows how to answer a request but does not listen on the network. Gunicorn listens on a port, parses HTTP, hands each request to the Flask app, and writes the response back. It also runs several copies of your app (**workers**) so one slow request does not block everyone, and it restarts workers that die or hang. The pinned version is `gunicorn==25.3.0`.

## Why this repository uses it

The lesson asks for a service that starts, answers, and **shuts down gracefully**: when told to stop, it finishes the requests in flight, then closes its database connections. Flask's built-in server is for development only; gunicorn is a production-grade server and lets the repository configure timeouts, request-size limits and shutdown behaviour in one small file.

## Where it appears

| Path | What it does with gunicorn |
| --- | --- |
| `src/notes_app/interfaces/gunicorn_conf.py` | All settings, written as Python variables. |
| `src/notes_app/interfaces/wsgi.py` | `build_app()` and `close_all()` used by gunicorn and its exit hook. |
| `Makefile` | `SERVE := .venv/bin/gunicorn -c python:notes_app.interfaces.gunicorn_conf "notes_app.interfaces.wsgi:build_app()"` |
| `Dockerfile` | `CMD ["gunicorn", "-c", "python:notes_app.interfaces.gunicorn_conf", "notes_app.interfaces.wsgi:build_app()"]` |
| `scripts/demo.sh`, `tests/e2e/test_scenario.py` | Start a real server for the scenario, then send it SIGTERM. |

## How it works underneath

1. You start one **master** process. It reads the config, opens the listening socket once, then **forks** (copies itself into) worker processes.
2. Each worker imports your app by the name you gave: `notes_app.interfaces.wsgi:build_app()` means "import that module and call `build_app()` to get the WSGI app".
3. All workers accept connections on the shared socket. With worker class `gthread`, each worker also runs a pool of **threads** (here 4), so one worker handles several requests at once. Total concurrency here is 2 workers x 4 threads = 8.
4. The master watches its children. A worker that is silent for more than `timeout` seconds is killed and replaced.
5. A **signal** from the operating system controls the master. `SIGTERM` (the polite stop, sent by `kill` and by `docker stop`) means graceful shutdown: stop accepting, let workers finish, then exit. `SIGINT` (Ctrl-C) does the same.
6. When a worker exits, gunicorn calls the `worker_exit(server, worker)` hook inside it. This repository uses the hook to close the database connection pool.

## Walkthrough of this repository's use

```python
bind = f"{os.environ.get('APP_HOST', '127.0.0.1')}:{os.environ.get('APP_PORT', '8047')}"
```
Where to listen. Default is the loopback address `127.0.0.1` (reachable only from the same machine). Inside Docker, Compose sets `APP_HOST: 0.0.0.0` so the container accepts connections, and the published port in `docker-compose.yml` is bound to `127.0.0.1` on the host, so the app is still not reachable from other machines.

```python
workers = int(os.environ.get("WEB_CONCURRENCY", "2"))
threads = 4
worker_class = "gthread"
```
Two worker processes (override with `WEB_CONCURRENCY`), each with four threads. `gthread` is the threaded worker. Because there are several processes, any state kept in a Python variable would be per-process. That is why the sign-in throttle lives in PostgreSQL (`login_failures`, see `tech/postgresql.md`) and not in memory.

```python
timeout = 30
graceful_timeout = 20
keepalive = 5
```
`timeout`: a worker that sends no heartbeat for 30 seconds is killed. `graceful_timeout`: after a stop signal, workers have 20 seconds to finish in-flight requests before being force-killed. `keepalive`: how long (seconds) an idle connection is kept open for another request.

```python
control_socket_disable = True  # no admin socket in the home directory: one fewer local attack surface
```
Gunicorn 25.1 added a **control socket** (a local file that the `gunicornc` tool uses to manage a running server). Turning it off means no extra file and no extra way to talk to the server.

```python
limit_request_line = 4094
limit_request_fields = 50
```
Refuse a request whose first line (method, path, version) is over 4094 bytes, or that has more than 50 header lines. These are denial-of-service guardrails (the gunicorn default for headers is 100).

```python
accesslog = None
errorlog = "-"
logconfig_dict = {
    "version": 1,
    "disable_existing_loggers": False,
    "formatters": {"json": {"()": "notes_app.infrastructure.logging.JsonFormatter"}},
    "handlers": {"stderr": {"class": "logging.StreamHandler", "formatter": "json", "stream": "ext://sys.stderr"}},
    "root": {"level": "INFO", "handlers": ["stderr"]},
    "loggers": {"gunicorn.error": {"handlers": ["stderr"], "level": "INFO", "propagate": False}},
}
```
`accesslog = None`: gunicorn writes no access log, because the application writes one structured line per request (with a request id, status and duration, and without the cookie or body). `errorlog = "-"` means "standard error". `logconfig_dict` is Python's `logging.config.dictConfig` format: it routes both the app's loggers and gunicorn's own messages through the repository's `JsonFormatter`, so every line is JSON. The `"()"` key means "create this formatter by calling this class". A `root` entry is required: without it dictConfig fails with "Unable to configure root logger" (a mistake made and fixed while building this).

```python
def worker_exit(server: object, worker: object) -> None:
    from notes_app.interfaces.wsgi import close_all
    close_all()
```
Runs in each worker as it exits. `close_all()` closes every database pool the process opened and logs `database pool closed`. The import is inside the function so the module is only loaded in a worker that actually built an app.

### How the app is named

`-c python:notes_app.interfaces.gunicorn_conf` loads the configuration from an importable Python module instead of a file path (`python:` prefix). `"notes_app.interfaces.wsgi:build_app()"` is the **application factory** form: gunicorn calls `build_app()` in each worker. `build_app()` reads `Settings.from_environment(os.environ)` first, so a missing `NOTES_DB_PASSWORD` stops the worker at start-up with a clear error rather than after serving traffic.

## Try it yourself

1. Check the version and your settings load:
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/gunicorn --version
   .venv/bin/python -c "import notes_app.interfaces.gunicorn_conf as c; print(c.bind, c.workers, c.threads, c.worker_class)"
   ```
   Expect `gunicorn (version 25.3.0)` and `127.0.0.1:8047 2 4 gthread`.
2. Start it (needs `make up`) and stop it politely:
   ```bash
   make run   # in terminal 1; press Ctrl-C when you want it to stop
   ```
   Expect JSON log lines, then on Ctrl-C a `Handling signal: int` line, `database pool closed`, and `Shutting down: Master`.
3. Run the whole shutdown proof:
   ```bash
   make demo
   ```
   Expect the last block to list `Handling signal: term`, `database pool closed` and `Shutting down` lines.
4. Ask the server for its health (while it runs):
   ```bash
   make health
   ```
   Expect `healthy`.

## Mistakes people make

- Running the development server in production.
- Binding `0.0.0.0` on a laptop and exposing the app to the whole network. Here the default is `127.0.0.1`.
- Keeping state in process memory when there are several workers (each sees different data).
- Setting `timeout` very high "to fix slow requests", which hides hung workers. Thirty seconds is kept.
- Killing with `SIGKILL` (`kill -9`): nothing gets cleaned up. Use `SIGTERM`.
- A log format that differs between gunicorn and the app, which makes logs hard to search. One `JsonFormatter` serves both.

## Check yourself

1. What is the difference between a worker and a thread here?
   *A worker is a separate process; each worker runs four threads that share its memory.*
2. What does `SIGTERM` make gunicorn do?
   *Stop accepting connections, let workers finish in-flight requests (up to `graceful_timeout`), then exit.*
3. Why must the throttle be stored in PostgreSQL?
   *With two worker processes, in-memory counters would be separate and an attacker could split attempts across them.*
4. What does `build_app()` do at the end of its call?
   *Returns the Flask app; before that it validates settings, configures logging and opens the database pool.*
5. What is `worker_exit` used for here?
   *Closing the worker's database pool during shutdown.*

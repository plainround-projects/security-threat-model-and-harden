# Docker and the Dockerfile

## What it is

**Docker** packages a program together with everything it needs (the Python interpreter, libraries, files) into an **image**: a read-only template. A **container** is a running instance of an image: an ordinary process on your machine, but isolated, with its own view of the file system, network and process list. A **Dockerfile** is the recipe text file that says how to build an image, one instruction per step. On macOS the containers run inside a small Linux virtual machine that Docker Desktop manages.

An image is made of **layers**, one per instruction that changes files. Docker caches each layer and reuses it if the instruction and everything before it are unchanged.

## Why this repository uses it

Two reasons. First, PostgreSQL runs as a container (`tech/docker-compose.md`), so the lesson needs no database installation. Second, the app itself is also packaged as an image to show a **hardened runtime**: a base image fixed by digest, hash-checked dependencies, a non-root user, a health check, no packaging tools left inside, and run-time restrictions (read-only file system, no Linux capabilities).

## Where it appears

| Path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Dockerfile` | Builds the `security-threat-model-and-harden:dev` image (27 lines). |
| `.dockerignore` | Keeps `.git`, `.venv`, `.env*`, caches, `tests`, `docs`, `logs`, `.github` out of the build context. |
| `Makefile` | `docker-build`, `docker-run`, `down`. |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Builds and runs the image under the `app` profile. |

## How it works underneath

1. `docker build .` sends the **build context** (the folder, minus `.dockerignore` entries) to the Docker engine.
2. The engine runs the instructions in order. `FROM` picks a base image; every later instruction runs on top and produces a layer.
3. `RUN` executes a command in a temporary container and saves the file changes as a layer. `COPY` adds files from the build context.
4. The result is stored by a **digest**: a SHA-256 of its content. A **tag** like `3.12-slim-bookworm` is a movable label; a digest is not.
5. `docker run` / `docker compose up` creates a container, starts the `CMD` as process number 1, and attaches the isolation settings.
6. Stopping sends `SIGTERM` to process 1, then `SIGKILL` after a grace period (10 seconds by default). Process 1 here is gunicorn, which handles `SIGTERM` gracefully (`tech/gunicorn.md`).

## Walkthrough of this repository's use

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm@sha256:6dd8b6dab6b3adc7812bab69eca5dbdc1a5cc690ad28306d234ffb4ef8ac9753
```
Start from the official Python 3.12 image on Debian 12 ("bookworm"), the `slim` variant (smaller). The `@sha256:...` pins the exact image content: if someone re-publishes the tag with different content, the build still gets the reviewed one, or fails.

```dockerfile
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
    PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1 \
    PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1
```
Environment variables for every later instruction and for the running container. No `.pyc` files (the file system may be read-only); no output buffering (logs appear immediately); pip keeps no download cache (smaller image) and does not phone home to check for a new version.

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.lock ./
RUN pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
```
Work in `/app`. Copy only the lock file and install from it, hash-checked (`tech/uv-and-lock-files.md`). Because this layer depends only on `requirements.lock`, Docker reuses it on every rebuild unless the lock changes.

```dockerfile
COPY pyproject.toml README.md ./
COPY src ./src
RUN pip install --no-deps .
```
Now the project: its metadata and source. `--no-deps` stops pip from resolving or fetching anything not in the lock.

```dockerfile
RUN pip uninstall -y pip setuptools
```
The packaging tools are not needed to run the service, and their vendored copies of other libraries are what vulnerability scanners most often flag in a slim image. Removing them shrinks the attack surface. (`-y` answers the confirmation.)

```dockerfile
RUN useradd --system --uid 10001 --no-create-home app
USER app
```
Create a system user with a fixed numeric id and no home folder, and run everything after, including the container's process, as that user. A process that is not root cannot write system files or bind low ports, so a compromise of the app is contained. A numeric id lets Kubernetes policies check "non-root" without reading `/etc/passwd`.

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 8047
```
Documentation only: the container listens on 8047. It does not publish the port (Compose does).

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=15s --timeout=10s --start-period=30s --retries=5 CMD ["notes-app-health"]
```
Docker runs the command every 15 seconds; exit 0 = healthy. `--start-period=30s` gives start-up time before failures count; five consecutive failures mark the container `unhealthy`. `notes-app-health` is the project's own command (`tech/python.md`) that GETs `/readyz`. No `curl` is needed in the image.

```dockerfile
CMD ["gunicorn", "-c", "python:notes_app.interfaces.gunicorn_conf", "notes_app.interfaces.wsgi:build_app()"]
```
The **exec form** (a JSON list) runs gunicorn directly as process 1. A string form would start `/bin/sh -c ...` and the shell would receive `SIGTERM` instead of gunicorn, breaking graceful shutdown.

### What the Dockerfile does *not* contain

No password, key or token. Check: `grep -iE "password|secret|token" Dockerfile` prints nothing. Secrets arrive at run time as environment variables from Compose.

### `.dockerignore`

```
.git
.venv
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
...
tests
docs
```
Files named here are not sent to the build context, so they can never be `COPY`'d into an image by mistake. `.env` holds the local passwords; excluding `.env.*` but re-including `!.env.example` keeps secrets out and the example in.

### Run-time hardening (in `docker-compose.yml`)

`read_only: true` (the container's file system cannot be written, except the `tmpfs` at `/tmp`), `cap_drop: [ALL]` (no Linux capabilities), `security_opt: ["no-new-privileges:true"]` (a process cannot gain privileges), the published port bound to `127.0.0.1` on the host.

### `.dockerignore`, line by line

Docker sends the project folder to the engine (the "build context") before building. `.dockerignore` lists what to leave out, so nothing in the list can be copied into an image by accident and the transfer is small.

| Line | Why it is excluded |
| --- | --- |
| `.git` | The history (and anything ever committed). |
| `.venv` | The local Python environment; the image builds its own. |
| `.env` and `.env.*` with `!.env.example` | Local secrets. The `!` line puts the example back: it holds no secret. |
| `__pycache__`, `*.egg-info`, `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.ruff_cache`, `.import_linter_cache`, `.omc` | Generated caches and tool folders. |
| `tests`, `docs`, `logs`, `.github` | Not needed to run the service. |

The Dockerfile then copies only what it names: the lock file, `pyproject.toml`, `README.md` and `src/`. Both mechanisms apply together: a file must pass the ignore list *and* be named by a `COPY`.

## Try it yourself

(Needs Docker running with free disk space.)

1. Build:
   ```bash
   make docker-build
   ```
   Expect `naming to docker.io/library/security-threat-model-and-harden:dev` at the end.
2. Inspect the layers:
   ```bash
   docker history security-threat-model-and-harden:dev | head
   ```
   Expect one row per instruction, with sizes; the lock install is the largest.
3. Check the user and that pip is gone:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm --entrypoint sh security-threat-model-and-harden:dev -c 'id; python -m pip --version'
   ```
   Expect `uid=10001(app)` and `No module named pip`.
4. Run it with the database (`make up` first) and watch the health state:
   ```bash
   make docker-run && docker compose ps
   ```
   Expect the `app` service `(healthy)`. Then `make down`.

(In the author's final verification this image built, started and reported `/readyz` 200; these four commands were not re-run when this note was written because the Docker engine's disk was full that night. Treat the expected outputs as what the Dockerfile above produces.)

## Mistakes people make

- `FROM python:latest`: a moving target. Pin by digest.
- Running as root in the container.
- Copying the whole folder, `.env` included. `.dockerignore` and the narrow `COPY` lines prevent it.
- Putting secrets in `ENV` or `RUN`: they stay in the image history forever.
- Shell-form `CMD`, which breaks signal handling.
- Installing dependencies after copying the source, which busts the cache on every code change.
- Leaving build tools in the final image.

## Check yourself

1. Image versus container?
   *An image is a read-only template; a container is a running instance of it.*
2. Why `@sha256:` after the tag?
   *A tag can be moved; a digest identifies exact content.*
3. Why the exec form of `CMD`?
   *Gunicorn becomes process 1 and receives `SIGTERM` directly.*
4. Why copy `requirements.lock` before `src`?
   *The dependency layer stays cached until the lock changes.*
5. What does `USER app` accomplish?
   *The container's processes run without root privileges.*
